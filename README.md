# bubblegumretro (pre-package)

A collection of components that I often use in my ,fairly idiomatic, style.

The styling is done using styled-components and style system.

All components are currently in a storybook.

## Installation

This is currently pre-package and cannot be installed using npm/yarn. However, one can clone this github rep. and run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run storybook
```

and this will set up a local storybook with all the current components.
